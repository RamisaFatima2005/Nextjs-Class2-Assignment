        <h1>Components</h1>
        <p>In Next.js, components are like building blocks for your website. They are small, reusable pieces of code that create parts of your web page. Instead of writing the same code over and over, you create a component once and use it wherever you need it.</p>
        <h1>Fragments</h1>
        <p>In Next.js, fragments are a way to group multiple elements together without adding extra HTML elements to the page.</p>
